# GiraffeQL

## What is GiraffeQL?

GiraffeQL is a JSON-friendly method of sending queries between the client and server. Inspired by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), GiraffeQL seeks to build upon GraphQL's strengths by providing a similar API while leveraging JSON's versatility and built-in support with popular languages, like Javascript and Typescript. Furthermore, as a package that has been built on top of the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), GiraffeQL can automatically expose an equivalent RESTful endpoint for each GiraffeQL root operation.
